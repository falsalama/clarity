# 0. Orientation

Clarity is a private, audio-first contemplative training system for the modern world.

In five minutes, it should steady the mind.
In five days, it should reduce reactivity.
Over time, it should reshape conditioning.

Reflection is the method.
Clarity is the outcome.

Clarity combines:

* Open-ended audio reflection
* Structured daily contemplative training
* A living Buddhist knowledge architecture
* Privacy-first local intelligence
* Non-reifying design principles

It is not a chatbot.
It is not therapy.

It is a restrained contemplative instrument designed to preserve clarity in a noisy age.

This document governs philosophy, architecture, UX direction, intelligence layering, and system constraints.
It exists to prevent drift.

---

# 1. Core Identity

Clarity exists to help users:

* Untangle experience
* Regain agency
* Reduce reactivity
* Strengthen skilful response

It does not instruct belief.
It does not impose ideology.
It does not construct identity.
It does not gamify insight.

Clarity preserves and adapts contemplative training for present conditions.

---

# 2. Sealed Principles (Non-Negotiable)

## 2.1 Local-First, Privacy-First

* Raw audio remains on device by default
* Transcripts remain on device
* No silent uploads
* No hidden analytics
* Cloud use is explicit and user-initiated only

Local intelligence must be “good enough” alone.

---

## 2.2 Redaction-First Architecture

* Sensitive material is stripped before any cloud processing
* Redaction happens locally
* The system is designed to forget

---

## 2.3 Explicit Consent (Cloud Tap)

* Any cloud intelligence requires deliberate user action
* Consent is visible, contextual, and reversible
* No background sync masquerading as help

Cloud enhances depth. It does not create dependency.

---

## 2.4 Non-Reification

Clarity does not:

* Diagnose
* Type personality
* Create psychological labels
* Convert transient states into fixed traits

All intelligence layers must avoid identity construction.

---

## 2.5 No Therapy Framing

Clarity:

* Does not provide medical advice
* Does not replace professional care
* Does not position itself as treatment

It operates as contemplative training within a recognised philosophical tradition.

---

# 3. Philosophical Orientation

Clarity operates within a Buddhist contemplative framework.

It aligns with:

* Attention training (samatha)
* Ethical refinement (śīla)
* Conditioning logic (karma as repetition)
* Gradual stabilisation of mind
* Examination of view and self-structure
* Non-reification (emptiness as design principle)

It does not:

* Require religious identity
* Require metaphysical belief
* Enforce doctrinal allegiance

Karma is framed as conditioning logic:

* Repetition strengthens patterns
* Intention shapes direction
* Emotional tone affects impact
* Behaviour reinforces structure

No supernatural claims.
No fatalism.
Clear causal training logic.

Clarity preserves vast contemplative teachings in contemporary form without theatricality or inflation.

---

# 4. Core Capabilities

Clarity consists of four primary surfaces:

* Welcome
* Reflect
* Learn
* Practice
* Progress

Each serves a distinct function.

---

# 4.1 Welcome Surface

The Welcome surface is:

* A rotating contemplative threshold
* Content-driven
* Remotely configurable
* Offline-first cached

It may rotate:

* Practitioner photographs
* Teacher or lama quotations
* Pilgrimage imagery
* Short Dharma-aligned phrases

Purpose:

* Establish tone
* Foster seriousness
* Encourage continuity

It is not:

* A feed
* A social surface
* A marketing banner
* Behaviourally targeted

Belonging without performance.

---

# 4.2 Reflect

Primary mode.

Audio-first capture with optional text.

Capabilities:

* Voice capture
* Local transcription
* Redaction
* WAL extraction
* Pattern learning
* Capsule integration
* Optional Cloud Tap synthesis

Reflect is open-ended.
It untangles present experience.
It never prescribes action.

---

# 4.3 Learn

Learning surface.

Short daily themes providing:

* Context
* Conditioning explanations
* Ethical framing
* Motivation guidance

Learn prepares understanding before Practice.

It must remain:

* Brief
* Clear
* Non-preachy
* Non-inflated

---

# 4.4 Practice

Applied daily contemplative training.

One instruction per day.

* Sequential progression
* No binge unlocking
* Repetition over novelty
* Optional dedication

Purpose:

To steady attention, create space before reaction, soften habitual compulsion, and support a calmer, more skilful capacity to respond.

Practice is foundational training, not achievement.

---

# 4.5 Progress Surface

Progress reflects continuity, not attainment.

It may include:

* Days completed
* Current module phase
* Visual metaphor (e.g., bloom)
* Practice continuity markers

It must never:

* Rank users
* Encourage comparison
* Reward volume over steadiness
* Trigger spiritual materialism

Progress is reflection on continuity.

---

# 5. 108-Day Foundational Module

Module One spans 108 days.

It is:

* Gradual
* Stabilising
* Lamrim-safe
* Compatible with Dzogchen without prematurely invoking advanced view

It progresses through nine phases:

1. Stabilising Attention
2. Recognising Reactivity
3. Softening Habit
4. Intention & Conditioning
5. Ethical Stability
6. Identity & View
7. Emotional Maturity
8. Compassion & Perspective
9. Integration & Spaciousness

This is one module among many.

Future modules may include:

* Applied Ethics
* Conflict & Communication
* Emptiness & Dependent Origination
* Silent Integration
* Teacher-guided study cycles

Progression is directional, not hierarchical.

---

# 6. Living Dharma Knowledge Architecture

Clarity includes a long-term Canonical Dharma Database.

This database contains:

* Scriptural references
* Commentary mappings
* Thematic categorisation
* View-specific metadata
* Regional tradition variants

It functions as:

* A contextual intelligence backbone
* An adaptive content source
* A sequencing engine for appropriate teaching depth

It is not exposed as a searchable library.
It operates beneath the surface.

---

## 6.1 APT Extraction (Abstraction → Primitive → Tendency)

Canonical teachings are processed into:

* Contemplative primitives
* Conditioning markers
* View distortions
* Ethical cues

These feed:

* WAL refinement
* Pattern learning
* Adaptive sequencing

---

## 6.2 WAL (Wisdom Abstraction Layer)

WAL extracts:

* Inner-state primitives
* Emotional tone
* Conditioning loops
* View tensions

It distinguishes:

* Lasting markers
* Decaying states
* Noise

It must avoid:

* Identity formation
* Psychological typing
* Interpretive leakage

---

## 6.3 Pattern Learner

Pattern learning:

* Is local-first
* Uses decay functions
* Separates stable vs transient markers
* Refines prompts and sequencing
* Remains anonymous and non-profiling

Over time, this allows:

* Vastly improved alignment
* Appropriate unfolding through teachings
* Cultural nuance
* Language sensitivity

Without constructing identity.

---

## 6.4 Capsule System

Capsule stores:

* User preferences
* Tone calibration
* Practice orientation
* Learned cues

Capsule is user-editable.
User sovereignty is preserved.

---

# 7. Intelligence Architecture

## 7.1 Local Baseline

Includes:

* Apple Speech
* Apple Foundation Models (on-device)
* Local Llama (where available)

Local intelligence must function independently.

---

## 7.2 Cloud Tap

Cloud Tap is:

* Explicit
* User-initiated
* Contextual
* Reversible

It supports:

* Deeper synthesis
* Structured questioning
* Remote content rotation
* Canon database retrieval

Cloud never overrides local sovereignty.

---

# 8. Global & Language Expansion

Clarity is designed for:

* Multilingual deployment
* Region-sensitive adaptation
* Cross-tradition compatibility

Future expansions may support:

* Theravāda emphasis
* Mahāyāna emphasis
* Vajrayāna contextual layering
* Secular framing

All governed by non-reification.

---

# 9. Audio Orientation

Audio is encouraged but optional.

Voice:

* Reduces self-editing
* Surfaces conditioning
* Strengthens immediacy

Silence remains valid.

---

# 10. Explicit Non-Goals

Clarity does not:

* Run streaks
* Award points
* Rank users
* Encourage competition
* Manufacture spiritual identity
* Promote consumption over repetition

Restraint is intentional.

---

# 11. Development Phasing

Phase 1: Reflection + 108-Day Module
Phase 2: Canonical Database Integration
Phase 3: Multilingual Expansion
Phase 4: Region-Adaptive Sequencing
Phase 5: Teacher-Integrated Tracks

Each phase must preserve sealed principles.

---

# 12. Governance Rule

When adding features:

Ask:

* Does this increase clarity?
* Does this reduce reactivity?
* Does this preserve privacy?
* Does this avoid identity construction?
* Does this avoid spiritual materialism?

If not, it does not belong.

---

# Closing Statement

Clarity is intentionally restrained.

Under the surface, it is vast.

Its architecture reflects its philosophy.

Its philosophy demands coherence as it grows.

Restraint is not limitation.
It is structural integrity.


Appendix A — Contemplative Architecture Principles
These principles guide sequencing, tone, and system behaviour.
They are not branding elements.
They are structural guardrails.
A1. Three Trainings (Triśikṣā)

No permanent rank.
Appendix B — Systemic Guardrails for Intelligence
(Technical interpretation of the above)
Pattern decay must exist.
Capsule must remain user-editable.
Cloud responses must match local tone.
Canon database retrieval must respect context depth.
No content escalation without stability markers.
No algorithmic amplification of agitation.
No reward loop based on emotional intensity.



Notes (possible future directions - keep open)
Clarity can remain reflection-first while gradually strengthening the daily practice layer: build a stronger completion moment (light confirmation + one-line “what did you notice?” + short dedication) so “Done” has meaning without gamification; explore progress as continuity-reflection (calendar/bloom/quiet visual deepening) rather than achievement; consider a Dzogchen-leaning tone and UI (more space, fewer words, calmer transitions) while keeping training structure gradual and lamrim-safe; introduce “sangha without feed” via rotating practitioner/teacher photos and quotes plus anonymous aggregate practice counts (no profiles, no ranking, no comments); keep the module path metaphor as a later option (subtle environmental deepening rather than avatar travel) once the core daily content stabilises; and phase toward a larger Buddhist knowledge backbone (canonical database + APT/WAL-driven sequencing, multilingual/regional adaptation) after the first practice content set is proven.
