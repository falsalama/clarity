## 0. What Clarity Is

Clarity is a **private, audio-first thinking instrument**.

Reflection is the method.  
Clarity is the outcome.

Clarity exists to help people **untangle experience**, regain agency, and see more clearly — without being told what to think, feel, or do.

It is not:
- a chatbot
- a therapist
- a mindfulness game
- a self-improvement scoreboard

---

## 1. Core Principles (Sealed)

These principles are non-negotiable for Clarity itself.

### 1.1 Local-First, Privacy-First
- Raw audio and transcripts remain on device by default
- No silent uploads
- No hidden analytics
- Cloud use is explicit and user-initiated only

### 1.2 Redaction-First Architecture
- Sensitive material is stripped before any cloud processing
- Redaction happens *before* intelligence
- The system is designed to forget

### 1.3 Explicit Consent (Cloud Tap)
- Any cloud intelligence requires deliberate user action
- Consent is visible, contextual, and reversible
- No background sync masquerading as “help”

### 1.4 Non-Reification
- Clarity does not label the user
- It does not diagnose
- It does not turn transient states into identities

### 1.5 No Therapy Framing
- Clarity does not claim treatment
- It does not replace human support
- It does not position itself as care

---

## 2. What Clarity Actually Does

### 2.1 Primary Interaction
- Voice capture is primary
- Text is optional
- Audio is treated as first-class data

### 2.2 Reflective Modes
Clarity offers distinct, bounded modes (local or Cloud Tap):
- Reflect
- Perspective
- Gratitude
- Talk-It-Through

Each mode:
- names what is present
- loosens grip
- returns agency

No advice. No prescriptions.

### 2.3 Outcome Orientation
Clarity measures success by:
- felt relief
- cognitive unknots
- regained clarity

Not engagement minutes.

---

## 3. Navigation & UI Doctrine

### 3.1 Tabs Are Functional, Not Narrative
- Tabs represent *capabilities*, not a journey
- iOS always has a selected tab; Clarity respects this

### 3.2 First-Run Welcome Is an Overlay
- Welcome is **not a tab**
- It appears only on first run
- It overlays the default tab (Reflect)
- It introduces options without blocking routing

This avoids:
- “no tab selected” states
- artificial onboarding flows
- navigation complexity

### 3.3 Capture Is Always Close
- The microphone affordance is always reachable
- Capture never feels buried behind structure

---

## 4. Storage Doctrine (Audio & Text)

### 4.1 Audio Is User-Generated Content
- Stored in Application Support
- Persistent across normal updates
- Never placed in tmp or Caches

### 4.2 Paths Are Not Identities
- Stored references must be **relative**, not absolute
- Absolute container paths are treated as legacy only
- Runtime resolution always asks the system for the current container

This prevents data loss illusions after reinstall/offload.

---

## 5. Intelligence Architecture

### 5.1 Local First
- On-device models are the baseline
- Local intelligence must be “good enough” alone

### 5.2 Cloud as Opt-In Amplifier
- Cloud Tap improves depth, not dependency
- Cloud responses must remain stylistically compatible with local output

### 5.3 WAL (Wisdom Abstraction Layer)
- Speech → inner-state primitives
- Inner-state primitives → reflective lenses
- No interpretation leakage
- No hidden profiling

---

## 6. Explicit Non-Goals (Clarity Proper)

Clarity itself does **not**:
- run streaks
- award points
- rank users
- gamify insight
- create spiritual status

These are design constraints, not omissions.

---

## 7. Considered Evolution Lane (Non-Binding)

The following section records **considered future directions**.  
Nothing here overrides the sealed principles above.

### 7.1 Possible Derivative / Rewrap
A future product (working name: *Untangle*) may:
- inherit Clarity’s architecture
- re-wrap it as a daily practice instrument
- introduce progression metaphors intentionally and ethically

This may exist as:
- a separate app
- or a forked evolution with a new canon version

### 7.2 Daily Practice Framing
A practice-oriented wrapper may introduce:
- Reflect / Focus / Inner Peace pillars
- gentle repetition
- structured entry when users “don’t know what to say”

### 7.3 Progress Without Spiritual Materialism
If progression exists:
- no leaderboards
- no competition
- no “more is better” loops

A **visual metaphor** (e.g. a 108-petal bloom) may be used as:
- continuity
- encouragement
- orientation

Not status.

### 7.4 Achievements as a Separate Space
- Achievements are **not a tab**
- Accessed via a top-right counter button
- Treated as reflection on continuity, not reward

### 7.5 Welcome as Living Surface
A welcome surface may:
- rotate imagery
- rotate short Dharma-aligned phrases
- be content-only
- be remotely configurable (e.g. Supabase Edge)

Constraints:
- offline-first
- no telemetry
- no user data dependency
- no dark patterns

---

## 8. Ethos Continuity

Whether Clarity remains singular or evolves:
- privacy remains primary
- agency remains with the user
- clarity remains the outcome

Anything that compromises those is out of scope.

---

## 9. Closing Statement

Clarity is intentionally restrained.

That restraint is not a limitation.  
It is the moat.

Any future evolution must earn the right to add structure by **not violating emptiness**.
